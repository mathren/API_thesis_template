    \chapter{Appendix as separate chapter}
    \label{app:seperate}

    You can define an appendix per chapter as in \autoref{ch:paper1},
    but you can also create an appendix that is a chapter by itself
    as done here.
    
    Either way works, but do not use the \verb|\appendix| function to make
    an appendix.
    
    \section{A section}
    Also, an appendix is a good place for storing excessive tables, figures, 
    or other stuff removed from papers.
